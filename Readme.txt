Dataset

In our research, we have used Turkey subset of the MAG World dataset. World dataset contains 12 tables and we have used only several tables of its Turkey subset. We have included 8 tables of Turkey subset in our repository. 

For subsetting Turkey dataset, we have written a function in tr_subsetting.R file. This function takes tr_affiliation_ids.txt} file as input; one can use another arbitrary file of affiliation IDs to extract the subset of MAG corresponding to those affiliations. User of this function must specify the directory of the world dataset and another directory for saving the Turkey subset. The function is based on sequentially merging the files which have common columns, and subsetting the rows which belong to the given set of affiliations. It can subset 8 tables, but one can extend the function to subset all 12 files. We suggest the user of the function to execute it on a server with at least 50 GB of RAM, because the merging operations require usage of a large amount of memory. 

In MF, we have used author-paper matrix as input. This matrix is obtained from PaperAuthorAffiliations_TR.txt file. In CMF we have used both author-paper and author-reference matrices. Author-reference matrix is obtained by merging PaperAuthorAffiliations_TR.txt and PaperReferences_TR.txt files. After preparing these files, we have mapped all the IDs of authors, papers and references into certain numbers, because the (C)MF codes take the input as an edgelist in which the entries are given with their corresponding row and column numbers, not IDs. We also provide a key file author_numbers_cmf.txt that shows the mapping between author names, IDs and their corresponding numbers in input files.


Codes

For both MF and CMF models, we provide two versions of functions; regularized and non-regularized versions. In MF, non-regularized version of function takes the following arguments: name of the file (filename), p (latent dimension), sample size for mini-batch (samplesize), initial step length (alpha0), and maximum number of iterations (maxiter). The only difference of its regularized version is the additional argument of regularization coefficient (beta). In CMF, non-regularized version of function takes the following arguments: name of the first file (filename1) in our case author-paper matrix, name of the second file (filename2) in our case author-reference matrix, p (latent dimension), sample size for mini-batch (samplesize), initial step length (alpha), and maximum number of iterations (maxiter). Its regularized version differs by three additional arguments of regularization coefficients (lambda1, lambda2, lambda3) corresponding to three factor matrices.

These codes are generic enough to be used with different sparse matrices that has similar form (edge list) as the input matrices that we provide. However, we have set the number of data points for testing set as 100000 in these codes as default. The user should change this number in accordance with her particular setup for training and testing set ratios.
